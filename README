 What is Devmon?
---------------------------------------

  Devmon is a Perl script that can monitor a large number of
  remote devices and report problems back to a display server
  running either the BigBrother or Hobbit monitoring software.


 How does Devmon work?
---------------------------------------

  Devmon uses SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to
  obtain the necessary information from remote hosts.  Right
  now, Devmon only supports SNMP versions 1 and 2c (v3 support
  might be added at a later date).

  Devmon determines which hosts to query based on information
  from the display server's bb-hosts file, which allows you
  to manage all of your monitoring facilities from a single file.

  Devmon can either run in a single-node configuration, a
  single machine does all of the work and reports back to the
  test server (Devmon can even be run ON the test server, for
  small networks), or Devmon can be run in a multi-node cluster.

  A multi-node Devmon installation is considerably more 
  powerful than a single-node one, as it allows you to query
  more hosts on a more timely basis, and it gives you automatic
  load balancing, node failure failover and scalability.  The
  downside, though, is that it is more complicated than a single
  node server, as it requires you to maintain a MySQL server,
  which is what the multi-node cluster uses as a backend for
  data storage.


 What are Devmon's prerequisites?
---------------------------------------

  In order for Devmon to do anything useful, you will need
  a machine capable of running the Perl interpreter, which
  is used to execute the Devmon code.  

  In addition, you will need a machine (either the same machine 
  running Devmon, or a different one) runing either the Hobbit/Xymon 
  or BigBrother monitoring program, which displays the messages
  that Devmon generates.  

  Finally, you will need your to have your Hobbit/Xymon or BigBrother 
  program set up to monitor at least  one host that Devmon has 
  a template for.   Only then will Devmon be able to poll a 
  remote host and display the results.  For more information on 
  Devmon's template system, please consult the TEMPLATES file
  located in the docs directory.
  

 How do I install Devmon?
---------------------------------------

  Detailed instructions are available in the docs/INSTALLATION
  file.  A single-node installation merely requires you to untar
  the Devmon tarball to a suitable location, modify the config
  file appropriately, and start the Devmon daemon.  

  A multi-node installation requires you to do all of the above
  on each node in the cluster, as well as set up a MySQL database
  to facilitate communication between nodes.


 What are Devmon templates?
--------------------------------------

  Devmon can monitor a virtually unlimited number of different 
  device types, by allowing a user to define a template for
  each test to be conducted on a particular device type.
  For instance, a 'cpu' test on a Cisco 2950 switch is its own 
  template, while a 'if_load' test on the same switch is an
  entirely different template.  For more on template creation
  and modification, please see the docs/TEMPLATES file.


 What kind of devices can Devmon monitor?
--------------------------------------

  Basically, any device that supports SNMP v1 or v2c can be
  monitored by Devmon.  Provided that you can determine which
  SNMP OIDs (Object IDentifiers) you want to monitor on that
  device, you can create your own Devmon template (provided
  that a template of the same type doesnt already exist)
  and Devmon will take care of the rest!


 What type of hardware/software does Devmon require?
--------------------------------------

  To date, Devmon has been tested and is known to work
  on Linux and FreeBSD.  Devmon might also run on other
  operating systems with little or no modification, if 
  you succeed at adapting Devmon to a new OS, please drop
  the author a line and let him know of your success.

  As for hardware, the requirements are entirely up
  to how fast you want your collector to be able to run.
  Obviously the machine needs to run an OS that can
  run the Perl binary;  but theoretically you could run
  Devmon on a 386 with 8MB of memory.

r256+Added Features: This code is based on the latest r256
This is a work in progress, changes can occur without notice

Main results
- Cisco, Wmware, Huawei templates updates
  - Cisco r1800, r1900, r2800, r2900, sw2940, sw2950, sw2960, sw3750
    sw3850, sw3650, swIE, rISR
  - Interfaces are ordered correctly
  - Layer 2 interfaces can be monitored easily
  - Correct all wrong calculations of traffic
  - Alarming on relative and absolute thresholds for traffic
  - Fan, Power and Module are monitored
- New "Blue" color for disabled tests
- Multiple tables support in a test with graph

New Features
- New tramsforms: 
  - Coltree: To collect data when there are "parent" oid   
  - Sort: to sort a table with another oid than the pri
  - Eval: should be avoided, but it's the perl5 eval fct 
- Added capabilities to Regsub: eg
  
Major bug resolved
- Threshold bug : 20% speed-up in some cases

Minor bug resolved
- If a test has multiple table, only last can be graphed
- Ability to assign empty value for (T)SWITCH
- Ability to graph, even not all values are defined

Workaround
- Multiple tables support: only 1 (but anyone) can be graphed
